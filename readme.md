# Lone Wolf
An app for scraping popular job websites, built with FastAPI and React. Most of the scraping related data is hardcoded in backend, while frontend is used only to display URLs, titles, and short descriptions.  
  
P.S. I expect that developers of the job websites will modify their frontend from time to time, so changes may be needed.
